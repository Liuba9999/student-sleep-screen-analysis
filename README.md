# Sleep, Screen Time, and Grades Analysis
This project analyzes how students' sleep and screen time relate to their academic performance using survey data.

## Project Files
- `cleaned_data_nsch_2023.csv: Final cleaned dataset with selected columns, ready for analysis
- `Childrens_sleephealth_cleaned_data.ipynb`: Cleaning and preparing the data
- `01_average_sleep_screen_hours.ipynb`: Exploring patterns and calculating averages with charts
- `02_data_kids_sleep_grade_2023.ipynb`: Continue to calculate data and compering data with charts
-  PDF versions of two notebooks with visualisation

## Kye Findings
- More sleep and less screen time are linked with better grades.
- Students who maintain consistent bedtimes generally achieve higher academic performance.

## Tools Used
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## Notes
The original data is too large to upload, so only the cleaned version is shared. You can find it here [NSCH Survey Data 2023 - Official Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abthecreator/childrens-health-nsch-2023-survey-data)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Open notebooks in Jupyter
3. Run cells step-by-step to see the analysis and charts
