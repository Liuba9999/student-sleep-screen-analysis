# Sleep, Screen Time, and Grades Analysis
This project analyzes how students' sleep and screen time relate to their academic performance using survey data.

## Project Files
- `cleaned_data_nsch_2023.csv: Final cleaned dataset with selected columns, ready for analysis
- `Childrens_sleephealth_cleaned_data.ipynb`: Cleaning and preparing the data
- `01_average_sleep_screen_hours.ipynb`: Exploring patterns and calculating averages with charts
- `02_data_kids_sleep_grade_2023.ipynb`: Continue to calculate data and compering data with charts
-  PDF versions of two notebooks with visualisation

## Kye Findings
- More sleep and less screen time are linked with better grades.
- Younger students usually sleep more and spend less time on screens.
